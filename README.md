## Description

This bot is designed and build for the YOINC discord server.

## FAQ
### Can I host my own version of this bot?

Yes. Currently, there are some properties that need to be set in the `config.properties`, however the goal would be to keep these properties to a low amount / reduce them over time.

As of now, you will need the following properties:
- `discord.key` = Your discord bot token
- `bungie.key` = Your bungie api key
- All API endpoints:
  - `dekarios.api`
  - `bungie.api`
  - `dashboard.api`

### Can I invite this instance to my server?

I would recommend against it.
